# Customer Clustering and Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on customer clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Files in this Repository
- **k-mean.ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook where the K-Means clustering model is developed, trained, and evaluated.
- **K_mean.pkl**: This file contains the trained K-Means model, which can be used for predicting customer clusters based on new data.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage
1-Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarelnabawi/Customer_Clustering.git
cd Customer_Clustering
```
2-Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
k-mean.ipynb
```
3-Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand the implementation and how to use the model for customer prediction.
## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: K-Means
-**Input Features**: Annual Income (k$),Spending Score (1-100)
-**Output**: Predicted customer clusters.
## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and make contributions or improvements to the model or analysis.
